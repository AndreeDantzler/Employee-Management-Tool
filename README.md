# Employee-Management-Tool

 ## Description
  Welcome to the Employee Management Tool

  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, I was tasked with architecting and building a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.


  ## User Story

I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company

 ## Acceptance Criteria

  Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:
